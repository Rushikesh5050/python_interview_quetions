        "\n",
        "5. **Explain the difference between `==` and `is` in Python.**\n",
        "   - `==` checks for equality of values, whereas `is` checks for identity, i.e., whether two variables refer to the same object in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **What is the `if` statement used for in Python?**\n",
        "   - The `if` statement is used for conditional execution. It allows you to execute a block of code only if a certain condition is true.\n",
        "\n",
        "7. **Explain the `for` loop in Python.**\n",
        "   - The `for` loop in Python is used to iterate over a sequence (such as a list, tuple, or string) or other iterable objects. It executes a block of code for each item in the sequence.\n",
        "\n",
        "8. **What is a function in Python?**\n",
        "   - A function in Python is a block of reusable code that performs a specific task. It can take inputs, perform operations, and return outputs.\n",
        "\n",
        "9. **How do you define a function in Python?**\n",
        "   - Functions in Python are defined using the `def` keyword followed by the function name and parameters, if any. For example: `def my_function(param1, param2):`.\n",
        "\n",
        "10. **What is a module in Python?**\n",

        "12. **What is the purpose of the `range()` function in Python?**\n",
        "    - The `range()` function generates a sequence of numbers. It is commonly used with loops to iterate a specific number of times.\n",
        "\n",
        "13. **Explain list comprehension in Python.**\n",
        "    - List comprehension is a concise way to create lists in Python. It allows you to generate a new list by applying an expression to each item in an existing iterable.\n",
        "\n",
        "14. **What is a dictionary in Python?**\n",
        "    - A dictionary in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is used to store data in the form of mappings, where each key maps to a corresponding value.\n",
        "\n",
        "15. **How do you access elements in a dictionary?**\n",
        "    - You can access elements in a dictionary by using square brackets `[]` with the key. For example: `my_dict['key']`.\n",
        "\n",
        "16. **Explain the concept of object-oriented programming (OOP) in Python.**\n",
        "    - Object-oriented programming is a programming paradigm that organizes code into objects, which are instances of classes. It emphasizes concepts such as encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.\n",
        "\n",
        "17. **What is a class in Python?**\n",
        "    - A class in Python is a blueprint for creating objects. It defines properties (attributes) and behaviors (methods) that all objects of the class will have.\n",

        "\n",
        "20. **Explain the concept of method overriding in Python.**\n",
        "    - Method overriding occurs when a subclass provides a specific implementation of a method that is already defined in its superclass. It allows a subclass to modify or extend the behavior of the inherited method.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Intermediate Questions:\n",
        "\n",
        "21. **What are the different access modifiers in Python?**\n",
        "    - In Python, access modifiers are not explicitly declared, but there are conventions. By convention, attributes prefixed with a single underscore `_` are considered protected, and those prefixed with double underscore `__` are considered private.\n",
        "\n",
        "22. **What is the purpose of the `__init__()` method in Python classes?**\n",
        "    - The `__init__()` method is a special method in Python classes used for initializing newly created objects. It is called automatically when a new instance of the class is created.\n",
        "\n",
        "23. **Explain the concept of method overloading in Python.**\n",
        "    - Method overloading refers to defining multiple methods in a class with the same name but different parameters. Python does not support method overloading by default, but you can achieve it using default parameter values or variable-length argument lists.\n",
        "\n",
        "24. **What is a generator in Python?**\n",
        "    - A generator in Python is a special type of iterator that generates values on the fly using the `yield` keyword. It allows you to iterate over a sequence without storing the entire sequence in memory.\n",
        "\n",
        "25. **What is a decorator in Python?**\n",
        "    - A decorator in Python is a function that takes another function as input and extends its behavior without modifying it explicitly. Decorators are often used to add functionality such as logging, authentication, or caching to functions.\n",
        "\n",
        "26. **Explain the concept of recursion in Python.**\n",
        "    - Recursion is a programming technique where a function calls itself to solve a smaller instance of the same problem. It is often used to solve problems that can be broken down into smaller, similar subproblems.\n",
        "\n",
        "27. **What are lambda functions in Python?**\n",
        "    - Lambda functions, also known as anonymous functions, are small, inline functions that are defined using the `lambda` keyword. They can take any number of arguments but can only have one expression.\n",
        "\n",
        "28. **What is the purpose of the `map()` function in Python?**\n",
        "    - The `map()` function in Python applies a given function to each item in an iterable (such as a list) and returns a new iterable containing the results.\n",
        "\n",
        "29. **Explain the difference between `append()` and `extend()` methods in Python lists.**\n",
        "    - The `append()` method adds a single element to the end of a list, whereas the `extend()` method adds multiple elements (from an iterable) to the end of a list.\n",
        "\n",
        "30. **What is the purpose of the `*args` and `**kwargs` parameters in Python functions?**\n",
        "    - The `*args` parameter allows a function to accept a variable number of positional arguments, while the `**kwargs` parameter allows it to accept a variable number of keyword arguments.\n",
        "\n",
        "31. **Explain the concept of shallow copy and deep copy in Python.**\n",
        "    - A shallow copy creates a new object but does not recursively copy nested objects, whereas a deep copy"

        "# This is a comment\n",
        "print(\"Hello, world!\")  # This is also a comment\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "5. What is the difference between `==` and `is` in Python?\n",

        "y = [1, 2, 3]\n",
        "\n",
        "print(x == y)  # True, because the values are the same\n",
        "print(x is y)  # False, because they are different objects\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "6. What are Python data types?\n",
        "   - **Answer:** Python supports various built-in data types, including integers, floating-point numbers, strings, lists, tuples, dictionaries, sets, and booleans.\n",

        "7. Explain list comprehensions in Python.\n",
        "   - **Answer:** List comprehensions provide a concise way to create lists in Python. They consist of an expression followed by a `for` clause, optionally followed by additional `for` or `if` clauses.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of a list comprehension\n",
        "squares = [x**2 for x in range(10)]\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "8. What is the `lambda` keyword in Python?\n",
        "   - **Answer:** The `lambda` keyword is used to create anonymous functions, i.e., functions without a name. They are often used as arguments to higher-order functions or in situations where a small function is needed temporarily.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "# Example of a lambda function\n",
        "add = lambda x, y: x + y\n",

        "print(obj.x)  # Output: 5\n",
        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "10. How do you handle exceptions in Python?\n",
        "    - **Answer:** Exceptions in Python are handled using `try`, `except`, and optionally `finally` blocks. Code that may raise an exception is placed inside the `try` block, and code to handle the exception is placed inside the `except` block.\n",
        "\n",
        "```python\n",
        "try:\n",
        "    x = 1 / 0\n",

        "```\n",
        "\n",
        "12. What are iterators and iterables in Python?\n",
        "    - **Answer:** An iterable is an object that can be iterated over, such as lists, tuples, and strings. An iterator is an object that implements the iterator protocol, which consists of the `__iter__` method to return the iterator object itself and the `__next__` method to retrieve the next value from the iterator.\n",
